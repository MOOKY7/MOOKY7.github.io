  <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

  <p>
    With a Ph.D. in Statistics and a proven track record in applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning models to solve real-world problems, I am passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. My research experience has given me deep expertise in Model Calibration, Uncertainty Quantification, and Bayesian Statistics, areas I’ve focused on throughout my Ph.D. and various projects.

    At Unlearn.AI, I leveraged machine learning and statistical techniques to deliver faster, smarter and more adaptable clinical trial solutions, collaborating with cross-functional teams to implement cutting-edge models in production. I specialize in developing advanced causal inference techniques and innovative solutions with Digital Twins to enhance data-driven decision-making.

    I perform best in environments where data is central to decision-making, with a strong focus on precision and innovation. Whether it's building scalable models, applying Bayesian techniques, or uncovering insights from complex datasets, I'm committed to expanding the potential of data.
